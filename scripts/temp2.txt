As the sun gracefully descends, casting its warm hues across the horizon, the meeting point of the river and mountains transforms into a spectacle of breathtaking radiance. The water reflects the golden palette of the sunset, shimmering with ethereal brilliance, while the mountains, bathed in a soft, amber glow, take on a majestic allure. Silhouettes are painted against the evening sky, and the serenity of the landscape is heightened by the gentle embrace of twilight.
